# RLSimu
RLSimu is intended to be an open-source, extensible Python package for simulating reinforcement learning (RL). It currently provides
* functions for generating randomized RL environments (with a discrete, finite state space)
* sample RL agent implementations
* code to simulate an agent's performance in a given RL environment

This is currently a work in progress. Docs will be added soon!
